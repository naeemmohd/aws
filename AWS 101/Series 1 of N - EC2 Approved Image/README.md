### Problem:
  * How to check if an Amazon instance is a valid approved image
 
### Solution:
  * You can use CLI as well as Console to perform this action
    * **Using CLI**
      - Use the below script 
      - Save the below script as checkIfValidApprovedImage.sh
      - Change the mode - chmod u+x checkIfValidApprovedImage.sh
      - The AWS command 'aws ec2 describe-instances' will return all instances in a specific region and is filtered by ImageId
      - The array arrImages is holding athe array of all ImageId
      - Run a for loop with command 'aws ec2 describe-images' to get the Image owner
      - If the image owner is not "Self" it is not a valid approved image specific to your own customized base image
      ```
      #!/bin/bash
      #  regions to check
      arrRegions=("us-east-1" "us-east-2");

      # image list
      for regionId in ${arrRegions}
      do
        echo "Instances for $regionId region:"
        arrImages=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --region $regionId --output text --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].ImageId');

        # get Image owner
        for imgId in ${arrImages}
        do
          aws ec2 describe-images --region $regionId --output text  --image-ids $imgId --query 'Images[*].ImageOwnerAlias'
        done
      done
		  ```
    * **Using Console**
      * Go to "EC2 Dashboard", Select "Instances" tab and then select a specific instance
      * In the "Description"Â tab, click on AMI ID link and select the AMI ID from the pop up. Copy the AMI ID.

      * Now go to AMI tab is Images section of EC2 Dashboard, and
      * Select "Owned by me" from the drop down and filter by AMIID. Paste the AMI ID for the filter.

      * If no rows are returned it means the images are either from Market Place or Amazon and are not "Self" customized approved valid image.
